/* L36_mixedradix -- forward complex-double 3D DFT of a fixed 36^3 cube.
 *
 * TECHNIQUE
 *   Row-column (three 1-D passes) with a Good-Thomas / prime-factor 4x9 line
 *   transform, batch-vectorised across the *lines* of each pass, and blocked so
 *   that each pass's working set is L1-resident.
 *
 *   36 = 4*9 and gcd(4,9)=1, so the Good-Thomas (prime-factor) map applies and
 *   the entire inter-stage twiddle stage vanishes:
 *
 *       n = (9*n1 + 4*n2) mod 36        (Ruritanian input map, n1<4, n2<9)
 *       k = (9*k1 + 28*k2) mod 36       (CRT output map, [9^-1]_4 = 1, [4^-1]_9 = 7)
 *       n*k = 9*n1*k1 + 4*n2*k2  (mod 36)  =>  W36^{nk} = W4^{n1 k1} * W9^{n2 k2}
 *
 *   so a 36-point DFT is exactly 9 independent 4-point DFTs followed by 4
 *   independent 9-point DFTs with *no* twiddles in between -- only a
 *   compile-time index permutation, which is free because every pass is already
 *   a strided gather/scatter.  The 9-point module is genfft's n1_9 FMA DAG
 *   (fftw-3.3.10/dft/scalar/codelets/n1_9.c) transcribed to interleaved
 *   vectors -- see the ST2G comment; the Cooley-Tukey 3x3 form it replaced
 *   (44 FMA-port ops vs n1_9's 40) survives as the tuner-gated "ct9" twin.
 *
 *   Interleaved complex is kept end to end (it is the driver's layout, so no
 *   de/re-interleaving pass exists at all).  A vector holds PW complex numbers
 *   = PW *lines* of the current pass, so every twiddle constant is
 *   lane-invariant and there is not one cross-lane operation inside the
 *   transform.  The y and x passes vectorise over the contiguous z index and
 *   need no data reorganisation whatsoever; only the z pass -- whose transform
 *   axis *is* the contiguous one -- needs a transpose, done in registers as
 *   PW x PW blocks of 128-bit complex lanes.
 *
 *   Pass structure -- two passes over the volume, not three:
 *     phase 1, per x-plane (36x36 complex = 20.25 KiB, L1-resident):
 *              36 z-lines (transpose in, transform, transpose out, into an L1
 *              plane scratch), then 36 y-lines straight into `out`.
 *     phase 2: 36*(36/PW) x-lines, in place in `out` (stride 20736 B), tiled PW
 *              consecutive z at a time so every touched cache line is consumed
 *              in full and each of the 36 x-streams is sequential.
 *   Traffic is read(in) + write(out) + read(out) + write(out); the 746 KiB
 *   volume fits the 1 MiB L2 of the target part, so phase 2 runs out of L2.
 *
 *   MEMORY MECHANISMS (all tournament-gated candidates, never defaults):
 *   * pf:   phase 2 prefetches its 36 x-streams by hand (`pf` lines ahead) --
 *           more streams than the L2 streamer tracks.
 *   * pfin: paced T1 prefetch of the phase-1 `in` read stream, 32 KB ahead
 *           (L36_pfa r3's PFIN, attributed), plus a small cold-window
 *           pre-coverage of in[b+1] from phase 2 (their PFNX).
 *   * pfw:  paced WRITE-INTENT prefetch (`prefetchw` via
 *           __builtin_prefetch(p,1,3)) over phase 1's cold-`out` store stream,
 *           one plane (2592 doubles) ahead, same pacing as pfin.  At streaming
 *           batch sizes every one of the 11664 output lines per volume costs a
 *           demand RFO from DRAM that nothing overlaps; prefetchw acquires the
 *           line exclusive ahead of the store while keeping the normal-store
 *           shape this node prefers over NT.  Borrowed from L36_pfa round
 *           panel_r5 (their pf=2 / PFWMID, node-selected at B=32 and B=256;
 *           in-arena inplace-pf2 90.5 vs inplace-pf1 156.6 at B=256), which in
 *           turn adopted it from L6_unrolled r3 (fused_pfw).
 *
 *   N1_9 DFT9 (this round's change -- the r9 VERDICT's L=36 directive).  Both
 *   named B=1 theories are dead by node measurement: caches (L36_pfa r8,
 *   fu = p1 + p2w) and the front end (r9, three independent nulls -- my own
 *   3.5x-smaller rolled codelet ran +22..24% SLOWER on the node, L36_pfa's
 *   2x walked-footprint A/B read 0.3%, L36_pencilfused's code-sharing halving
 *   read flat).  The one unfalsified lever is arithmetic: the 9-point module.
 *   The Cooley-Tukey 3x3 form costs 44 FMA-port vector ops; genfft's n1_9
 *   FMA DAG (fftw-3.3.10/dft/scalar/codelets/n1_9.c, 24 add + 56 fma = 80
 *   scalar FMA-port ops) costs 40 + 2 more port-5 shuffles.  L45_pfa r9
 *   transcribed it first (correct on the first build, accuracy slightly
 *   improved) and wrote the mechanical rule; the r9 VERDICT SS6 names porting
 *   it to the three L=36 arms as the geometry's single highest-value item.
 *   Per line: 248 -> 232 FMA-port ops (-6.5%), 49 -> 57 shuffles (port 5 is
 *   ~20% loaded here, the right direction to trade).  Calibration from
 *   L45_pfa's identical bet: their -5.5% of port-0 ops bought +1.2% at B=1
 *   -- expect single digits, not the 35 us residual.  The CT 3x3 form stays
 *   compiled as the tuner-gated "ct9" twin (cached pool, listed last behind
 *   the 3% hysteresis bar; FFT36_CT9=0|1 forces the pools for paired A/Bs),
 *   and the plan description reports both pf0 twins' steady-state times so
 *   the node's own arithmetic verdict rides the leaderboard whatever the
 *   pick (L36_pfa's r8 probe-through-description pattern, attributed).
 *
 *   ANTI-ALIAS SCRATCH PINNING (r8; now DEFAULT-OFF everywhere).  The
 *   y-subloop loads the plane scratch and stores `out` at the same 576-byte
 *   stride; pinning slides the scratch inside 4 KB of slack so
 *   (pout - pl) mod 4096 is a chosen constant (best plateau PIND = 2112).
 *   r8 shipped it always-on in the cached regime and the node priced it at
 *   0 to -1.2% (B=1 118.5 -> 120.0, the only change on that path), and the
 *   lottery rationale died separately: L17_matrixsimd r8 showed glibc's
 *   mmap'd allocations give FIXED relative offsets across processes.  The
 *   machinery stays (zero cost when off) and FFT36_PIND=<bytes> (env, read
 *   once at plan time; -1 = off) remains absolute for monitor A/Bs.
 *
 *   RETIRED (see the strategy record for the numbers): the NT-store path and
 *   cross-volume xv prefetch (r6; node rejected NT four rounds running), sp2
 *   source-interleaved transform pairs (r8; +7.7% wallaby, +5% Haswell, and
 *   the node's own r7 tournament declined it), nta constant-lead input
 *   prefetch (r8; zero node picks across all three L=36 entries' three
 *   independent forms in r7 -- closed by null), the V2 kernel (256-bit
 *   EVEX; never picked on the node in seven rounds, and the only source of
 *   noisy-window mis-picks on wallaby), and the rolled DSB-resident codelet
 *   (r10; node probe read rolled +22..24% SLOWER than unrolled at B=1 --
 *   the front-end theory measured absent, r9 VERDICT SS2).
 *
 * OPERATION COUNT (per 36-point line, as vector instructions over PW lanes)
 *       DFT4       :  8 FMA-port ops + 1 shuffle   x9  =  72 +  9
 *       DFT9 n1_9  : 40 FMA-port ops + 12 shuffles x4  = 160 + 48
 *       total      :                    232 FMA-port ops + 57 shuffles / PW lines
 *   (ct9 twin: DFT9 = 44 + 10 -> 248 + 49, the r1..r9 codelet.)
 *   In real flops: 9*20 + 4*(24 + 2*56) = 180 + 544 = 724 flops per 36-point
 *   line; per volume 3 * 36^2 * 724 = 2,814,912 flops in 3888 line transforms
 *   (the DAG trades 16 flops/line for 16 fewer FMA-port instructions).
 *
 * ASSUMPTIONS
 *   * L == 36 only; fft3d_supports() refuses everything else.
 *   * `in` and `out` are 64-byte aligned and distinct (the driver guarantees
 *     both).  Every vector access made here is at a multiple of 64 bytes from
 *     the volume base -- (x*1296 + y*36 + zb*PW)*16 with 4 | 1296, 4 | 36.
 *   * `out` doubles as the working buffer between phase 1 and phase 2.  `in` is
 *     never written.
 *   * Two kernels are compiled: V0 = AVX2+FMA (2 complex lanes, 16 ymm) and
 *     V1 = AVX-512F (4 complex lanes, 32 zmm).  fft3d_create() checks CPU
 *     support, verifies the AVX-512 kernel numerically against the AVX2 one,
 *     then times all surviving (kernel x mechanism) combinations and keeps
 *     the fastest.

 * on output slots congruent to k1 mod 4.
 *
 * The DFT9 is genfft's n1_9 FMA DAG (fftw-3.3.10 dft/scalar/codelets/n1_9.c,
 * 24 add + 56 fma = 80 scalar FMA-port ops) transcribed pairwise to
 * interleaved vectors: 40 FMA-port ops + 12 shuffles (the CT 3x3 twin below:
 * 44 + 10).  Transcription rule (L45_pfa round panel_r9, attributed): every
 * scalar re/im line pair is one vector op; every re/im crossing is one VSWAP
 * with the signs folded into an alternating [c,-c,...] constant row.
 * Stage A per radix-3 column j = {xj, xj+3, xj+6}: sJ = column sum, SJ =
 * full sum, aJ = xJ - sJ/2, iJ = VSWAP(xJ+3 - xJ+6); pJ/qJ = aJ -+ i*s3*eJ
 * (the two rotated DFT3 outputs).  Block k={0,3,6} is a DFT3 on the sums;
 * blocks k={1,4,7} / k={2,5,8} build w = (1 -+ c*i)*p (one VSWAP+FMA each),
 * cross them (u, z), and fan out through the K984/K492/K852 spine. */
